We use two biomedical knowledge graph datasets in our study. The **Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI)** dataset is obtained from the Decagon project and is available on the [Stanford SNAP website](https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10017/10017-ChChSe-Decagon.html). We also utilize a processed subset of the **MedicalKG** dataset, and the preprocessed data is provided in the `MedicalKG/` directory of this repository. In addition, we include the **WN18RR** dataset as a general-domain benchmark, which can be downloaded from [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wn18rr).
